## Description

The Electronics Store is an online marketplace for pre-build computers and computer parts. The user can buy components straight from the site and/or use the interactive pc builder to select specific parts to buy for a pc build. It can be difficult finding a good online store for computer parts. Here, the user can do that after carefully planning out their build.

## Installation

To install, run 

1. ```npm install```
2. ```npm run seed```
3. ```npm run develop```

This will run the development server of the application.

## Usage

The user can click the signup button to create an account. This will allow them to checkout the items in their cart. If the user is in need of information, they can use the convinient virtual assistant found in the bottom right hand corner of the screen.
